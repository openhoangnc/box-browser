# BOX Browser
A browser with no pop-ups and no redirects.

"BOX Browser" is fully free/libre (as in freedom) Android app. The source code is public. The app also does not need any unnecessary
permissions. It's a simple Android browser based on webview. The intention is to provide a simple and light weight but powerful
browser with a nice looking user interface.
